Review
"Very nice experience! Hotel is bit older but very well maintained and clean, comfortable beds and sheets. Staff is very helpfull, pool is wonderfull as well as bowling. Perfect for families with kids. Very nice breakfast and especially view on the ocean from the room. Hotel is directly on the beautiful beach, next doors there is nice pizzeria with terrace on ocean. Currently hotel is under consecutive renovation so soon it will be even nicerüòâüëçvery close to Porto (approx 1hour)."
"What to say about the Axis Ofir Beach Resort Hotel?

I first want to say that this is the 3rd or 4th time we stay at this property, and I really wanted to wait to post a review. The reason I opted to wait is that my rating and review were going to be very low, as we were disappointed with the hotel's condition, room cleanliness, and unacceptable misses during breakfast.
Having said this, I am pleased to post a 5-star review, and not because our stay this time has been perfect, but because of the huge improvements we have seen, and because of how the staff continues to amaze us with their hospitality.
I want to give a special shout out to Milena, a member of the Housekeeping/Public Space team. She was cleaning the floor by the restaurant, there was no member of the staff in the dining room, and there were no bananas or plain yogurt out, so she went above and beyond when we asked her to call someone, and went into the kitchen herself, brought out a couple of bananas for our starving and cranky toddler, and told the F&B team to come help us. This is what hospitality is about. Please give her a raise or something.
Our room was super clean, and the mildew issue has been corrected almost 100%. The room attendants are very nice, clean well, and engage with us in the hallways. They pay attention and clean our room as soon as we leave for breakfast.
The Front Desk staff is great, especially Fabio, if I got his name right, who checked us in, and has always been working during all of our stays, and was the only good one last time we had issues.
The maintenance staff is great too, as one of them helped us with the bathroom sink.
You can really tell how the new director has turned things around (yes, we asked because we could really see an improvement) and a nice initiative was to have Christmas treats and drinks down in the lobby starting on Christmas' Eve.

Great job to everyone! I highly recommend this hotel!"
"Good food
Excellent views
Nice beach

Service is good. If you are American you will think it‚Äôs rude or poor service because staff are not outwardly offering advice or suggestions. Remember, find a place to sit and staff will come in a while. (it‚Äôs just culturally different)"
"My room was pretty nice. We had a beautiful ocean and forest view. The walk thru the hotel to the dining room was a bit confusing at first, but the food was worth it. The service was nice, even though i found hairs from the cleaning lady a few times in my room after she came. They gave you cards that you could exchange for a towel at the reception and most of the staff was nice and spoke almost fluently English. The location was a bit dull, but the beach was nice, and there was a little convenience store by the hotel that had stuff like sweets, alcohol, paper towels, postcards, and swimming equipment. Overall, it was a great experience.
*p.s: the beds were nice too"
"This is a 3 star hotel (and we are being kind); the rooms are miserable (smells, mold, lack of maintenance and refurbishing). The rest of the hotel is beaten up."
