Review
"Superb service and amazing location!! The staff was so thoughtful and attentive, we loved the free welcome drink and the kind explanations. The suite we stayed in was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Location was so central and convenient to everything we wanted to see. I especially appreciated that they helped mail back an article of clothing I forgot in the room when we left! So grateful for Axis Porto Club Hotel!!"
"Lovely boutique hotel in a super central location. Rooms were spacious and clean. A little noise outside as it's on a fairly major road, but it didn't bother us (we were at the front on a low flow too). Staff were great, free welcome glass of port was a nice touch. Only negative feedback is they could do with some better food warmers for the warm breakfast elements, but that's a minor issue."
"We arrived already at 10am and were prepared to store our luggage and come back in the afternoon to check in, but the kind staff at the reception checked if there was a room ready and checked us in early. The rooms are beautifully designed and spacious and have good king-sized beds and modern, functional bathrooms with beautiful-smelling toiletries. Wonderful details, such as a wireless phone dock plus power outlet plus two USB outlets on both sides of the bed, two armchairs and a little side table, a desk with chair, a wardrobe with hangers and drawers, two large mirrors, a free bottle of water, and a minibar. We had a room facing the old backyard, which was charming over daytime, as we could open the huge French balcony doors to bring in fresh air. Breakfast had good options, also for people who don’t eat meat and dairy. We also got a welcome glass of port wine in the hotel bar. Location is great, in walking distance to lots of sights and great vegan restaurants, supermarket 200m up the road, lively neighborhood, bus and metro stop and taxi stand close-by, and Uber never let us wait for more than 3 minutes.
One minor and one major annoyance:
While we were there, the elevator was being serviced which led to partial unavailability on two of the 4 days we spent there. Staff solved it by letting us take the service elevator in the back, so that was just a minor issue. However, the temperature on the third floor, where we had our room, was way too hot for November (outside it was only 15°C). We set the thermostat to 17°C to cool it down, but the A/C was deactivated for winter, so it didn’t cool. We asked staff to regulate the heating down, as we couldn’t do it in the room, but alas to no avail. When we tried to open the French balcony doors at night to cool the room down, strong kitchen exhaust came into the room from the backyard, so we closed them again. I can’t sleep well in overheated rooms, so that was a bit of a bummer. Maybe it’s less of an issue on other floors"
My wife and I enjoyed staying at this hotel in Porto.   It has an old facade but very modern interior.  The rooms are very comfortable  and the location is ideal as it is close to the main attractions.   The staff are friendly and knowledgable.  The welcome Port drinks were great too.
"This is a beautiful boutique hotel in a convenient location.
Staff are well-trained, polite, caring and go the extra mile.
Our one-bedroom suite was excellent with thoughtful amenities and design.
The location worked well for us, as we could walk to the water or other sites easily.
Will return in the future!"
