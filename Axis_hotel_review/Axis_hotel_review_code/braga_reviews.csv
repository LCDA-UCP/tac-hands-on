Review
"Group of Professional colleagues stayed here and loved it.
We had a large group multi course dinner, all yummy and the service, excellent."
I really like that i had 3 hourse before i could check in. Also the yellow and red stain design on my mattress was really nice. Oh and i love that there is a locked door in my room. Overall great place
"There was mold in our room and the ac dropped water on the floor. I got symptoms so we asked for the possibility to change rooms, however we were informed that there were no free rooms available. the next day we heard that our friends had successfully changed rooms due to the smell of cigarettesâ€¦"
"Looks like a hospital, also the elevators need fixing! The food is great, but so sick of soup every dinner."
"A good hotel to stay in. It is close to old town center and right next to the train station. Upon starting hiccup with room reservations the kind personnel at the reception did some magic and remedied the situation. For breakfasts it might seem they have little to offer but you can easily combine different things plus different desserts. TVs in time are small but we didn't go to Braga to watch TV. The hotel's name is Basic. If this is what you expect, you will like it there."
