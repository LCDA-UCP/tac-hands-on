Review
"I have a wonderful stay in this hotel. I got room upgrade, the room is spacious, and has everything I need, such as fridge and kettle. The breakfast and dinner buffets are tasty. The staff in this hotel can speak English and even Chinese very well.
Free access to the gym and swimming pool, the gym and swimming pool are big and well furnished.
About 20 minutes walk to the train station, and all the tourist attractions."
"Poor quality hotel
- Their towel policy is just ridiculous. If you are a guest in the hotel, you are told you are not allowed a gym towel, yet they ask you to use one when you are in there? Very rude reception team about it. Then, when you check out, you have to bring the wet towel back down to reception.
- Room is very hot, uncomfortable bed and lots of wasted space.
- They then overcharged me nearly 400 euro and refusing to give it back, so I’ve had to claim it back through the bank."
"A great experience all around, helpful staff, good, clean, spacious rooms.
The SPA is great and we use it whenever possible to relax."
"My partner and I recently enjoyed a delightful 3-night stay at Hotel Axis in Viana do Castelo. For us, a blend of convenience and tranquility was key, and this hotel nailed it with its location – just a quick 5-minute drive from the city center.
The modern ambiance of the hotel, with its clean lines and straightforward furnishings, created a practical and comfortable setting. As a business traveler, the reliable and efficient staff made the entire experience seamless, from check-in to check-out.
Our room provided a serene space with essential amenities and a charming city view, ideal for a restful night's sleep. The unexpected highlight was the well-equipped gym, perfect for maintaining our fitness routine together.
In summary, Hotel Axis is an excellent choice for people seeking a blend of tranquility and modern comfort. Whether you're in Viana do Castelo for business or leisure, this hotel caters to both, offering a practical and comfortable escape."
"The hotel had a unique architecture design, and is located near restaurants and supermarkets, which is useful since they don't let you know before hand that they have the restaurant fully booked due to conferences being hosted there.
Regarding the room, it was big and simple, however I found some dirtiness in the drinking glasses and floor, which felt like they didn't put much effort cleaning.
Regarding the indoor pool, it was located inside the hotel, but we had to go through the gym and the locker rooms in order to get there, and had little places to place our stuff, since they only had 5 chairs."
