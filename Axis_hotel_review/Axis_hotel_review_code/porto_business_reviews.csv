Review
"The hotel is very far from the centre of the city. We didn’t want to stay in the city because we only intended to stay 1 night.  But there aren’t any restaurants or shops close to the hotel so unless you have a car or use transit your options for dining will be limited to the hotel restaurant.  We ate at the lounge one night and it was not good.  All they were able to offer us late at night was a ham and cheese sandwich with potato chips.  The potato chips were the best part of the meal.

There is a 5 EU charge to park in their lot but it is a very steep incline to get to the lot and difficult to maneuver so we parked our rental car on the street.  There is no problem with parking behind the hotel.

The room was clean and well maintained but it is very small.  The staff are friendly and try very hard but we found not too knowledgeable.  We asked about finding a hospital as my husband had to go to emergency and the gentleman told us it was only 4 blocks away.  It was over a mile away.  We walked over a mile to get to the emergency department where we spent 11 hours.  We had to book another night because we were too late to get to our next destination.

When we called the hotel to book for another night they said they only had 1 room left but they would not hold it with our credit card.  It is against company policy.  If the room was gone when we got there – too bad.

They cater to tour groups.  There were 2 tour groups and the breakfast room was very loud and crowded with the tour groups getting ready to leave.  Breakfast was uninspired.

This is not a 4* hotel but a basic 3*.  It is very isolated and we did not feel it was good value for the money."
"Straightforward, comfortable business hotel. It was full of coach loads of tourists from various countries, but the noise levels were OK. We had a room at the back on the 2nd floor, which was in a  quiet neighbourhood. The bed was very comfortable with loads of pillows and the amenities were good, including a bidet and a decent hair dryer in the bathroom and a safe as well as coffee and tea making facilities. The shelf space around the wash hand basin was limited, but we managed and the shower was good.  The room was spacious and spotlessly clean. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. This was the best feature of the hotel. Reception, bar, and restaurant teams were all lovely. Our safe battery failed and the reception and maintenance guys went out of their way to resolve things quickly for us. The food was a decent, plentiful buffet at breakfast which was included, and dinner was good value. A convenient location for the University where we had a conference and a short walk to the metro D line for other parts of Porto for tourists. A pleasant experience overall."
"I like to travel a lot and stayed in lots of hotels. This hotel is not even worth 1 star.
Paying €700 of euros for 3 nights, but nothing is included in the price except the dirty old fashioned, poorly isolated rooms. And on the booking site all this information is hided somewhere backscreen in small letters, which is intentionally a scam.
You have to pay additional €5 pp to swimming pool, max 1 hour a day and mandatory to buy swimming cap €5 pp and slippers €5 pp. the spa, sauna etc all extra payment. Breakfast not incl. €10 pp and for what ? Poor breakfast menu.
Never ever visit again. No recommendation !!!"
It’s not a bad hotel — the decoration is dark and the location is terrible.  In the middle of a residential area and you have to walk a mile or two to take the metro into Porto.
"Nice hotel, it's clean and the staff was friendly & helpful. Spa treatments were very relaxing."
