"Friendly Staff and Convenient Location, but Some Drawbacks

The staff here is extremely friendly and always ready to help. When we arrived, the AC wasn't working, but it was promptly fixed the next morning while we were having breakfast.

The included breakfast, however, could use some improvement. It’s the same every day and offers limited options for those who don't consume animal products. On the plus side, we were allowed to bring our own food alternatives, which was appreciated. Breakfast hours are from 7:00 to 10:30, which is quite convenient.

The location is great if you're traveling with kids and want easy access to the sea or the pool. There's plenty of space around the outdoor pool for children to play. However, be aware that some rooms don't have balconies, so drying wet clothes can be a bit tricky—you might need to improvise in your room.

The rooms are clean, and you can request extra towels, sheets, pillows, etc., at no additional charge, though this is only available in the mornings.

One downside is the lack of lounge spaces suitable for working or taking calls. The room itself isn’t really set up for this either, which could be a challenge if you want to work during your stay. The WiFi is ok:

"Great location next to the beach and nice view of the Atlantic Ocean. Decent rooms, amenities like a pool and gym. The only let down was the breakfast which had limited options and the staff at the restaurant were somewhat unfriendly."
"The Axis Vermar Conference & Beach Hotel in Povoa de Varzim falls short of its 4-star rating in several key areas.

Positive Aspects

Clean rooms: This is a positive point and suggests a basic level of hygiene is maintained.
Good pool: A pleasant amenity, especially during warmer months.
Excellent spa and massages: A highlight for those seeking relaxation.
Negative Aspects

Below 4-star standards: This is a significant issue as it suggests a discrepancy between the hotel's advertised rating and actual service.
Limited ironing facilities: Only one ironing room for the entire hotel is inconvenient.
No late check-out option: This can be a major drawback for guests with late flights or other plans.
Repetitive breakfast: Lack of variety in the morning meal can be disappointing.
Poor bar service: Long wait times, incorrect orders, and guests opting for external dining are serious issues.
Unengaging entertainment: The described entertainment might not appeal to all guests.
Overall Impression

While the hotel has some positive aspects, the overall experience seems to be negatively impacted by several service-related issues. Guests might want to consider alternative accommodations if these factors are important to them."
"Rooms are ok. Showers are dated. Staff are polite. Restaurant is terrible. Almost like being at school, with school dinners. The evening meal was a choice of a piece of overcooked fish or Bolognese. I took the latter, but it had no taste. The restaurant had no character at all. I used the spa but it was equally disappointing.

The room has coffee/kettle, but no milk/cream. The coffee machines at breakfast had both run out of water when I tried them.

The hotel is very much a conference centre and not at all suitable for couples to stay."
"Excellent hotel,pleasant efficient  staff , own access to promenade and beach,splendid pool and gardens ,food is plentiful but could be more varied."
