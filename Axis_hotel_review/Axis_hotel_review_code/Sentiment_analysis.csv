Poor quality hotel Their towel policy ridiculous If guest hotel told allowed gym towel yet ask use one Very rude reception team Then check bring wet towel back reception Room hot uncomfortable bed lots wasted space They overcharged nearly euro refusing give back I claim back bank,1,"Poor quality hotel
- Their towel policy is just ridiculous. If you are a guest in the hotel, you are told you are not allowed a gym towel, yet they ask you to use one when you are in there? Very rude reception team about it. Then, when you check out, you have to bring the wet towel back down to reception.
- Room is very hot, uncomfortable bed and lots of wasted space.
- They then overcharged me nearly 400 euro and refusing to give it back, so I‚Äôve had to claim it back through the bank.",NEGATIVE,0

While we were in the pool there was a teacher screaming beside us while she was giving a class to the kids, it's impossible to relax. Also the gym is facing the swimming pool so basically we had a bunch of people working out and staring at us. It's very uncomfortable .

What say Axis Ofir Beach Resort Hotel I first want say rd th time stay property I really wanted wait post review The reason I opted wait rating review going low disappointed hotel condition room cleanliness unacceptable misses breakfast Having said I pleased post star review stay time perfect huge improvements seen staff continues amaze us hospitality I want give special shout Milena member Housekeeping Public Space team She cleaning floor restaurant member staff dining room bananas plain yogurt went beyond asked call someone went kitchen brought couple bananas starving cranky toddler told F B team come help us This hospitality Please give raise something Our room super clean mildew issue corrected almost The room attendants nice clean well engage us hallways They pay attention clean room soon leave breakfast The Front Desk staff great especially Fabio I got name right checked us always working stays good one last time issues The maintenance staff great one helped us bathroom sink You really tell new director turned things around yes asked could really see improvement nice initiative Christmas treats drinks lobby starting Christmas Eve Great job everyone I highly recommend hotel,5,"What to say about the Axis Ofir Beach Resort Hotel?

I first want to say that this is the 3rd or 4th time we stay at this property, and I really wanted to wait to post a review. The reason I opted to wait is that my rating and review were going to be very low, as we were disappointed with the hotel's condition, room cleanliness, and unacceptable misses during breakfast.
Having said this, I am pleased to post a 5-star review, and not because our stay this time has been perfect, but because of the huge improvements we have seen, and because of how the staff continues to amaze us with their hospitality.
I want to give a special shout out to Milena, a member of the Housekeeping/Public Space team. She was cleaning the floor by the restaurant, there was no member of the staff in the dining room, and there were no bananas or plain yogurt out, so she went above and beyond when we asked her to call someone, and went into the kitchen herself, brought out a couple of bananas for our starving and cranky toddler, and told the F&B team to come help us. This is what hospitality is about. Please give her a raise or something.
Our room was super clean, and the mildew issue has been corrected almost 100%. The room attendants are very nice, clean well, and engage with us in the hallways. They pay attention and clean our room as soon as we leave for breakfast.
The Front Desk staff is great, especially Fabio, if I got his name right, who checked us in, and has always been working during all of our stays, and was the only good one last time we had issues.
The maintenance staff is great too, as one of them helped us with the bathroom sink.
You can really tell how the new director has turned things around (yes, we asked because we could really see an improvement) and a nice initiative was to have Christmas treats and drinks down in the lobby starting on Christmas' Eve.

Great job to everyone! I highly recommend this hotel!",POSITIVE,1

We had a beautiful ocean and forest view. The walk thru the hotel to the dining room was a bit confusing at first, but the food was worth it.

They gave you cards that you could exchange for a towel at the reception and most of the staff was nice and spoke almost fluently English. The location was a bit dull, but the beach was nice, and there was a little convenience store by the hotel that had stuff like sweets, alcohol, paper towels, postcards, and swimming equipment.

The staff here is extremely friendly and always ready to help. When we arrived, the AC wasn't working, but it was promptly fixed the next morning while we were having breakfast.

The included breakfast, however, could use some improvement. It‚Äôs the same every day and offers limited options for those who don't consume animal products. On the plus side, we were allowed to bring our own food alternatives, which was appreciated. Breakfast hours are from 7:00 to 10:30, which is quite convenient.

The location is great if you're traveling with kids and want easy access to the sea or the pool. There's plenty of space around the outdoor pool for children to play. However, be aware that some rooms don't have balconies, so drying wet clothes can be a bit tricky‚Äîyou might need to improvise in your room.

The rooms are clean, and you can request extra towels, sheets, pillows, etc., at no additional charge, though this is only available in the mornings.

One downside is the lack of lounge spaces suitable for working or taking calls. The room itself isn‚Äôt really set up for this either, which could be a challenge if you want to work during your stay. The WiFi is ok:

Positive Aspects

Clean rooms: This is a positive point and suggests a basic level of hygiene is maintained.
Good pool: A pleasant amenity, especially during warmer months.
Excellent spa and massages: A highlight for those seeking relaxation.
Negative Aspects

Below 4-star standards: This is a significant issue as it suggests a discrepancy between the hotel's advertised rating and actual service.
Limited ironing facilities: Only one ironing room for the entire hotel is inconvenient.
No late check-out option: This can be a major drawback for guests with late flights or other plans.
Repetitive breakfast: Lack of variety in the morning meal can be disappointing.
Poor bar service: Long wait times, incorrect orders, and guests opting for external dining are serious issues.
Unengaging entertainment: The described entertainment might not appeal to all guests.
Overall Impression

While the hotel has some positive aspects, the overall experience seems to be negatively impacted by several service-related issues. Guests might want to consider alternative accommodations if these factors are important to them.",NEGATIVE,0

Showers are dated. Staff are polite. Restaurant is terrible. Almost like being at school, with school dinners. The evening meal was a choice of a piece of overcooked fish or Bolognese. I took the latter, but it had no taste. The restaurant had no character at all. I used the spa but it was equally disappointing.

The room has coffee/kettle, but no milk/cream. The coffee machines at breakfast had both run out of water when I tried them.

We didn‚Äôt want to stay in the city because we only intended to stay 1 night.  But there aren‚Äôt any restaurants or shops close to the hotel so unless you have a car or use transit your options for dining will be limited to the hotel restaurant.  We ate at the lounge one night and it was not good.  All they were able to offer us late at night was a ham and cheese sandwich with potato chips.  The potato chips were the best part of the meal.

There is a 5 EU charge to park in their lot but it is a very steep incline to get to the lot and difficult to maneuver so we parked our rental car on the street.  There is no problem with parking behind the hotel.

The room was clean and well maintained but it is very small.  The staff are friendly and try very hard but we found not too knowledgeable.  We asked about finding a hospital as my husband had to go to emergency and the gentleman told us it was only 4 blocks away.  It was over a mile away.  We walked over a mile to get to the emergency department where we spent 11 hours.  We had to book another night because we were too late to get to our next destination.

When we called the hotel to book for another night they said they only had 1 room left but they would not hold it with our credit card.  It is against company policy.  If the room was gone when we got there ‚Äì too bad.

They cater to tour groups.  There were 2 tour groups and the breakfast room was very loud and crowded with the tour groups getting ready to leave.  Breakfast was uninspired.

This is not a 4* hotel but a basic 3*.  It is very isolated and we did not feel it was good value for the money.",NEGATIVE,0

The rooms are beautifully designed and spacious and have good king-sized beds and modern, functional bathrooms with beautiful-smelling toiletries. Wonderful details, such as a wireless phone dock plus power outlet plus two USB outlets on both sides of the bed, two armchairs and a little side table, a desk with chair, a wardrobe with hangers and drawers, two large mirrors, a free bottle of water, and a minibar. We had a room facing the old backyard, which was charming over daytime, as we could open the huge French balcony doors to bring in fresh air. Breakfast had good options, also for people who don‚Äôt eat meat and dairy. We also got a welcome glass of port wine in the hotel bar. Location is great, in walking distance to lots of sights and great vegan restaurants, supermarket 200m up the road, lively neighborhood, bus and metro stop and taxi stand close-by, and Uber never let us wait for more than 3 minutes.
One minor and one major annoyance:
While we were there, the elevator was being serviced which led to partial unavailability on two of the 4 days we spent there. Staff solved it by letting us take the service elevator in the back, so that was just a minor issue. However, the temperature on the third floor, where we had our room, was way too hot for November (outside it was only 15¬∞C). We set the thermostat to 17¬∞C to cool it down, but the A/C was deactivated for winter, so it didn‚Äôt cool. We asked staff to regulate the heating down, as we couldn‚Äôt do it in the room, but alas to no avail. When we tried to open the French balcony doors at night to cool the room down, strong kitchen exhaust came into the room from the backyard, so we closed them again. I can‚Äôt sleep well in overheated rooms, so that was a bit of a bummer. Maybe it‚Äôs less of an issue on other floors",NEGATIVE,0
