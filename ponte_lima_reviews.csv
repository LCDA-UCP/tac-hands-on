Review
"I am rating this Hotel so low as I know other more accommodating Axis hotels in the area.
Room: no matter how good the room is, if you have a mattress that you can feel every spring sticking out the rating cannot be high.
Service: I slept there during a business trip and the ours of the gym are starting at 8 am without a chance to get in a bit earlier. So this leads to the service I booked for to be unusable
Standort: of course to play golf it’s great but otherwise there is nothing around and only one restaurant in save walking distance"
"The first 18kms of our Camino today were a great walk unfortunately the last 6kms were a nightmare as we had to walk along a very busy road!
However on reaching this accommodation all our tiredness disappeared.  It was luxury!
The rooms were fabulous and the staff very helpful.
We ate outside in the grounds of the restaurant. The food was excellent:  the staff were entertaining and helped make our evening so enjoyable.
Would definitely recommend this property."
"Axis golf ⛳️ in ponte de Lima is a great place to enjoy a challenging forest 🌳 course located in the oldest village of Portugal 🇵🇹 that old world charm 🏌🏼‍♂️great food, pleasant staff & natural surroundings"
"The hotel was very disappointing for me. The swimming pool, spa and gym are runned by a third party, they are inside of the hotel but everyone can use it, is not for hotel gests only. There are swimming classes in the pool and only 2 lanes are reserved for hotel gests. While we were in the pool there was a teacher screaming beside us while she was giving a class to the kids, it's impossible to relax. Also the gym is facing the swimming pool so basically we had a bunch of people working out and staring at us. It's very uncomfortable . The room is ok, but there is nothing in the room, no amenities or water. Also there was no balcony in out room. The hotel is a bit outdated, the carpet were dirty. Overall is not a good value for money and I would not recommend it."
"The hotel is nice clean and comfortable, but there's no spa rather than a fitness club with pool accessible for hotel guests. Staff friendly"
